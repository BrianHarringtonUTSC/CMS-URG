This comment will be used to describe the problem that we (or the participants)
wish to create a python script for. It will contain the following section
(in order)
1.     Context: This provides background for the question and introduces
                an element of comprehension.
2.      Action: This describes what the goal of the script it, strive
                to be moderately explicit.
3.     Example: One or more examples of input and expected output.
4.       Hints: This is an optional part of the question, and aims to provides
                a sense of direction towards some solution.
5.    Reminder: This section is to remind students to double check their
                work by running the script (and instructions on how to do so).
